The given algorithm is a recursive function called palandrom, which checks whether a given string ch is a palindrome. It starts by initializing two variables i and j to traverse the string from the start and end simultaneously. The algorithm compares characters at corresponding positions i and j. If they are equal, it moves closer to the center of the string by incrementing i and decrementing j and makes a recursive call. If a mismatch is found, it returns false to indicate that the string is not a palindrome. If all pairs match, it returns true, indicating a palindrome. The algorithm continues until all pairs have been compared or a mismatch is found.
